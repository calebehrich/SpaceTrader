The year was 3401 and you are a famous space traveler who made a fortune smuggling goods for the
Galactic Cartel. There wasn't a space cop in the galaxy who didn't know who you were. A majority of your
life was spent on the Galaxy's Most Wanted list. Until, it all came crashing down. On a fairly routine 
smuggling run to Saturn, you were betrayed.

Space travler2 had been part of your crew for the last couple years. You and ST2 had become friends in that 
time but the Galactic Police got dirt on him. ST2 had made a mistake, when he was an amateur smuggler, that 
lead to the death of a cop. He has been on the run ever since, but the police finally caught up to him. 

After making a delivery on Saturn you and ST2 were in a bar celebrating another successful delivery. ST2 stepped 
outside for a smoke when the cops used their intel to arrest him. You were unaware he was arrested. You assumed
he found a "companion" for the night and went home.

When the police brought him in for questioning, he sold you out. He made a deal. He told them he would turn you
in to save himself. While you were sleeping on your ship, the police barged in and arrested you. You were sentenced
to 21 years in the Galactic Penitentiary.

The year is now 3422 and you are out of prison. In your old age, you've decided to make an honest living from now on.
You will now earn your living as a straight forward space trader. Good Luck!!
